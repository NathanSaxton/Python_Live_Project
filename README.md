# Python_Live_Project

## Introduction

  Over the course of 2 weeks I had an awesome opportunity to work with a group developing a full scale MVT application using the Django framework in Python. I had the opportunity to build on and expand a pre-existing application while focusing on my own individual stories. We used the Azure DevOps for our project management and it felt great learning to work with a team and I know I'll be using this experience with all my work in the future. I used this opportunity to create an application that displays a webpage with the ability to add to a database, edit/delete from the database, and information accessed from an external API.
